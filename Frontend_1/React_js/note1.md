## What is bundler? 
A bundler in React is a tool that combines and processes your project files (like JavaScript, CSS, and images) into a few optimized files that the browser can load efficiently.


## what is component ?
Components are like functions that return HTML elements.


Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.

▫️Components come in two types, Class components and Function components, in this tutorial we will concentrate on Function components.

## what is JSX
👨🏻‍💻 **JSX allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without any createElement()  and/or appendChild() methods.**

JSX converts HTML tags into react elements.👨🏻‍💻
🌐JSX stands for JavaScript XML, and it is a special syntax used in React to simplify building user interfaces. JSX allows you to write HTML-like code directly inside JavaScript, enabling you to create UI components more efficiently.
## ✅Definition of Babel in React:
Babel is a JavaScript compiler used in React to convert modern JavaScript and JSX code into plain JavaScript that browsers can understand.

### 🔍 Why Do We Need Babel in React?
React code uses:

JSX syntax (like <h1>Hello</h1>) → Not supported by browsers

Modern JavaScript (ES6+) features → Not supported in all browsers

#### 👉 Babel helps by:

Converting JSX to regular React.createElement(...) calls

Transpiling modern JS (like let, const, arrow functions, etc.) into older versions

### ✅ What does Vite use to convert JSX to React code?
Vite uses ESBuild by default for transforming JSX.

🔧 Here's how it works:
When you write JSX like:
```
const App = () => <h1>Hello Vite</h1>;
```
👉 Vite uses ESBuild (a super-fast JavaScript bundler and transpiler) to convert JSX into React-compatible JavaScript during development.
