## ✅ Why static-typing?

You typed this manually in the URL (/blog/static-typing). It's just the dynamic value of the [slug] part. It could be anything — for example:

/blog/hello-world → { slug: 'hello-world' }

/blog/javascript-basics → { slug: 'javascript-basics' }

/blog/static-typing → { slug: 'static-typing' }

So static-typing is just the example slug you used.
